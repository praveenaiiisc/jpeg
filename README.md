# jpeg-and-yolo-implementation
* Problem 1: JPEG Implementation
* Problem 2: Comparison of perceptual quality measures
* Problem 3: Train a YOLO v7 Object Detection model. Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the given test set.
  Compute the following metrics: (i) mAP@0.5IoU; (ii) mAP@[0.5:0.95]IoU (take average of mAP at 10 IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05)
